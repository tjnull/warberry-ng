## ðŸ’¡ Overview

`warberry-ng` is a **next-generation toolkit** designed to automate the setup, customization, and deployment of **Kali Linux ARM devices** (like the Raspberry Pi) for use in **red team engagements**, **physical intrusions**, and **pentesting assessments**.

Inspired by the original [Warberry Pi](https://github.com/secgroundzero/warberry), this project shifts focus toward enabling the operator with **modular scripts** to turn a vanilla Kali Pi into a mission-ready, stealthy dropbox or recon device.
